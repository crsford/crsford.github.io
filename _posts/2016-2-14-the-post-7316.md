<p>Finally, I have some time to write! I now have Tuesdays and Thursdays set aside for writing. I may even begin a &nbsp;picture book. That Idea is exciting because I never think that I need to publish it just play around with ideas and writing. A picture book is short enough that I think of it like a fun puzzle. However, writing a novel for me is serious business. Speaking of which, the Jimmy Ruth novel from here on out to be titled, Every Godly Thing, is challenging me to step into some areas of my own personality that I haven't thought about in a very long time. I'm going to learn a great deal about myself in writing about Jimmy. But, she is not me, just as Cecelia is not me and Ria is not me. Although I share things in common with them. It's an amazing process that I love. This business of story. How I hope I can again be in the business as I set aside time for it and begin to investigate the possibilities once again.</p>
