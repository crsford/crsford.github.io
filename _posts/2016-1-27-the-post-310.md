title: 'Finding an Agent, Ugh!'
type: post

---
<p>The search for an agent continues. I will wait one month until I send my work to another. &nbsp;However, in the meantime, my work may be accepted for representation before the end of the month. I really believe in what I've written and am continuing to write. It means something. A girl against violence. A girl who is brave enough to put fear into a man's heart. I believe in the strength of young women. I believe in their power. But sometimes that power is robbed.. It must be rediscovered. It must be integrated back into us and used. Ria, the main character, does this because she refuses to turn away from trouble. Her one main flaw is that she can not look away. &nbsp;It's both a flaw and her strength.</p>
