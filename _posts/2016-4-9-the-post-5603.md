<p>Here I am again, not writing much, ugh! &nbsp;I've been editing though. I need to do some research about Wilmington and then once I've absorbed it, I'll begin on Every Godly Thing again. I have a new character, Azle. She is interesting in that she's an anomaly. I think she'll bring out good things in Jimmy Ruth. Because Jimmy is reflected in those eyes of Azle's. She not only is reflected but reflects on herself her situation. I write so much better in poetry. This is a prose novel and in that regard I'm not happy. I think once I get it all down, I can then play around with language. Can't wait to read Yiddish for Pirates, speaking of language. Need to order it. Hope it's not one of those that has lovely language but does not draw me in.&nbsp;</p>
