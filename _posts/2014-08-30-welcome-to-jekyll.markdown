I am currently in the process of updating my website.  My son, David, is designing and updating this site.  I would truly be appreciative for your feedback in regards to this endeavor.  If you have any suggestions or criticisms, please feel free to contact him directly.  [David Ford](mailto:djfordz@gmail.com "Email David").

My newest book, *The Navy's Night Before Christmas* is now available in bookstores and online through Amazon.com or any of the other major retailers.  I am currently teaching in Yangju, South Korea, however my intent is to return to Texas at the end of the year and open a quaint little thrift shoppe, where I can settle into and sell my artwork and other knicknacks.    I am excited about this upcoming endeavor and if your ever in Texas I hope you would stop by, bring one of my books and I'll be more than happy to autograph it as well :).

I will be instituting a commenting system into this site so people will be able to leave comments and feedback to my journal articles as they see fit.  Look for it soon!

Until next time, much love and peace.
