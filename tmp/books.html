    <h1>The Navy's Night Before Christmas</h1>

<p><img src="/christineford.org/img/navy_carousel.png" alt="The Navy's Night Before Christmas" /></p>

<p>This story, written for military families, is about a visit from the Santa of Sailors to those who can't be home for Christmas.</p>

<blockquote><p>'Twas the night before Christmas, when way out to sea
Not a creature was stirring to windward or lee.
The sailors were nestled all snug in their racks
Like orders of pancakes, so tight were the stacks.</p></blockquote>

<p>One Christmas Eve out at sea, some homesick sailors are paid a visit by Master Chief Claus, the Santa of Sailors. This lively and poignant tale was inspired by Clement C. Moore's classic yuletide poem.

<h1>The Soldier's Night Before Christmas</h1>

<p><img src="/christineford.org/img/soldiers_carousel.png" alt="The Soldier's Night Before Christmas" /></p>

<blockquote><p>'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the base
Only sentries were stirring—they guarded the place.
The soldiers were sleeping and snoring away
As they dreamed of ‘back home’ on good Christmas Day…</p></blockquote>

<p>One Christmas Eve at a military barracks in the Middle East, some homesick soldiers are paid a visit by Sergeant McClaus, the Santa of Soldiers. This lively and poignant tale is inspired by Clement C. Moore’s classic yuletide poem.</p>

<h1>Ocean's Child</h1>

<p><img src="/christineford.org/img/oceans_child_carousel.png" alt="Ocean's Child" /></p>

<p>As a mother and child canoe along the Alaskan Beaufort seacoast, they observe a baby walrus held close to its mother’s spotted chest, sea lions snuggling, and the Northern Lights shimmering above. David Diaz’s powerful, lush illustrations bring to life the majesty of the ocean and skies—and the vulnerability of the ocean’s biggest and smallest inhabitants, from the orca to the puffin.</p>

<p>The book ends with the human mother and her sleeping child gliding home for the night.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Good night, Mother Ocean, good night.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The artwork is done in the same finely crafted, softly colored graphic style that Diaz used in The Pot That Juan Built (Lee &amp; Low, 2002) and César: Si, Se Puede!/Yes, We Can! (Marshall Cavendish, 2004).</p>

<p>He has projected swirly reflection-like patterns in the water that seem to bounce off clothing, boat, and sea animals, along with representations of plant life and bubbles.</p>

<h1>Snow!</h1>

<p><img src="/christineford.org/img/snow_inset_carousel.png" alt="Snow!" /></p>

<blockquote><p>Slide slide down
we glide
Swish swoosh
goes our ride</p></blockquote>

<p>All the magical moments of a new snow spread across each of these pages. The steady rhythm of Christine Ford’s joyous ode to snow follows two youngsters as they trudge along with their sleds in tow to exult in a day of winter play’from building a snowman and sledding to a hot chocolate warm-up at the end. Painted and paper-collage illustrations capture all the cool contrasts a blanket of white can bring.</p>

<p>From the Growing Tree series comes another fine picure book for the youngest book lovers. Ford’s rhyming verse is age appropriate: “Wiggle wiggle / window squiggle / Frosty smiles / giggle giggle.” The couplets work well with Whitman’s watercolor collage illustrations, and they show readers the great and special things about a snowy winter. Brother and sister and their pet dog spend the day with Dad outside in the freshly fallen snow. They go sledding, catch snowflakes on their tongues, throw snowballs, make a snowman. And as the day darkens, Dad takes them home for a nice warm snack: “Mmm mmm / warm and toasty / Fire glows / hot and roasty / Day of snowy fun is done / Snowy night / has just begun.” Kathy Broderick</p>

<h1>Scout</h1>

<p><img src="/christineford.org/img/scout_carousel.png" alt="Scout" /></p>

<p>Cecelia prides herself on being the lookout in the woods behind her Texas home. After all, a person as skinny and gullible as Redbud, the new kid at school, needs someone to watch over him. Besides, with Pop spending all his time in the garden, Sis off with her boyfriend, and Cecelia’s mom dead and gone, it’s not like Cecelia has anything else to do.
When Redbud trusts her enough to show her where he lives and introduces her to his father, the rigid sergeant major, Cecelia doesn’t know what to think. Maybe Redbud just needs more discipline, like the sergeant major says. Or maybe she isn’t the lookout, the scout, that she thought she was.</p>

<h3>From Booklist</h3>

<p>Gr. 5-8. With short lines and an immediate first-person narrative, the free verse in this first novel is that rare combination–an easy read and beautiful poetry. Cecilia, 11, is happy about her friendship with Redbud, the new boy in school, and they have uproarious fun in her beloved Texas woods. Then she discovers that her friend’s home has harsh secrets. The detailed nature writing and the existential questions about “Who do you think you are?” seem more appropriate for adults than for the target middle-grade audience. But the spare, rhythmic words bring close the friends’ imaginative play outdoors, with details of river, trees, and animal life. In contrast is the anguish inside Redbud’s abusive home, where his unemployed father, a Vietnam veteran, uses “discipline” to keep the boy in line. At first Cecilia admits that she finds the father’s power fascinating, but by the close of the novel she realizes that his discipline is “just another word for fear,” and she has faced her grief about her mother’s recent death, as well as the anger, guilt, hurt, and love in her own home.
