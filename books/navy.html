<p>This story, written for military families, is about a visit from the Santa of Sailors to those who can't be home for Christmas.</p>

<blockquote>
    'Twas the night before Christmas, when way out to sea
    Not a creature was stirring to windward or lee.
    The sailors were nestled all snug in their racks
    Like orders of pancakes, so tight were the stacks.
</blockquote>
<p>
One Christmas Eve out at sea, some homesick sailors are paid a visit by Master Chief Claus, the Santa of Sailors. This lively and poignant tale was inspired by Clement C. Moore's classic yuletide poem.
