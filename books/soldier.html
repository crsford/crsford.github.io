<blockquote>
'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the base
Only sentries were stirring—they guarded the place.
The soldiers were sleeping and snoring away
As they dreamed of ‘back home’ on good Christmas Day…

One Christmas Eve at a military barracks in the Middle East, some homesick soldiers are paid a visit by Sergeant McClaus, the Santa of Soldiers. This lively and poignant tale is inspired by Clement C. Moore’s classic yuletide poem.
