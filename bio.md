Christine lives in a cabin near the Trinity Estuary in the beautiful Ft. Worth Nature Refuge. She regularly hikes, kayaks and visits Mav the buffalo whenever heâ€™s in summer pasture. Places she has lived and travelled have informed her writing, including her frequent travels to a Thai monastery near San Diego, CA. It is a place not only of extraordinary beauty but where visitors from around the world live and work together in community. She is a member of the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators. Christine develops and presents programs for children at local libraries and volunteers to read to children wherever she can fill a need. She is a former English as a Second Language Teacher and taught middle-school and high school students in North Texas as well as Elementary students in South Korea.
