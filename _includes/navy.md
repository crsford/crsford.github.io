This story, written for military families, is about a visit from the Santa of Sailors to those who can't be home for Christmas.

> 'Twas the night before Christmas, when way out to sea
> Not a creature was stirring to windward or lee.
> The sailors were nestled all snug in their racks
> Like orders of pancakes, so tight were the stacks.

One Christmas Eve out at sea, some homesick sailors are paid a visit by Master Chief Claus, the Santa of Sailors. This lively and poignant tale was inspired by Clement C. Moore's classic yuletide poem.
