> 'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the base
> Only sentries were stirring—they guarded the place.
> The soldiers were sleeping and snoring away
> As they dreamed of ‘back home’ on good Christmas Day…

One Christmas Eve at a military barracks in the Middle East, some homesick soldiers are paid a visit by Sergeant McClaus, the Santa of Soldiers. This lively and poignant tale is inspired by Clement C. Moore’s classic yuletide poem.
