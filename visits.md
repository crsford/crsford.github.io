School and Library Visits

One of my favorite things to do besides writing is to come to your school or library where I talk about the writing process from beginning a story to completion of book. I wear many hats from writer/creator, editor, marketer, school and library program presenter, and sometimes teacher. I present my picture-book original art, and book galleys to help students visualize the process.
My visits are always fun and imaginative and we all learn as well as create.
The goal of the program is for students to engage in the process by producing a poem from an object or image using their senses and what they know of the poetry elements. Our goal is not to write the perfect poem but one that is satisfying with a touch of surprise, like a thoughtful gift.
