School Visits

One of my favorite things to do besides writing is to come to your school. 
My visits are always fun and imaginative and we all learn as well as create.
The goal of the program is for students to produce a poem from an object or
image using their senses and what they know of the poetry elements.

Our goal is not to write the perfect poem but one that is satisfying with
a touch of surprise, like a thoughtful gift.
