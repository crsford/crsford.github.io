    <p>When I wore littlest moccasins<br>
    I stood tall in them<br>
    Tall like the far mountain,<br>
    Sometimes running toward it<br>
Along with the birds<br>
My heart wide open<br>
With the range<br>
To stop, listen<br>
Was that my father’s voice<br>
High up on the ridge?<br>
Or wood birds?<br>
Don’t go, not yet<br>
Littlest one<br>
Wait till your moccasins grow—</p>
