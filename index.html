'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the base
Only sentries were stirring—they guarded the place.
The soldiers were sleeping and snoring away
As they dreamed of ‘back home’ on good Christmas Day…

    'Twas the night before Christmas, when way out to sea
    Not a creature was stirring to windward or lee.
    The sailors were nestled all snug in their racks
    Like orders of pancakes, so tight were the stacks.

<blockquote>
Cecelia prides herself on being the lookout in the woods behind her Texas home. After all, a person as skinny and gullible as Redbud, the new kid at school, needs someone to watch over him. Besides, with Pop spending all his time in the garden, Sis off with her boyfriend, and Cecelia’s mom dead and gone, it’s not like Cecelia has anything else to do.
